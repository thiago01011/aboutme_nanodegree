        The best Instagram bios tend to have a self-description.
        Things to consider adding: your job title(s), the company
        you own or work for, some claims to fame, things you love,
        and what makes you stand out.

        Queen Latifah’s Instagram bio does a great job of describing
        her. In the first line of her bio she writes, ‘Actor/Rapper/
        Singer/Producer.’ When people visit her fanpage, they’ll
        learn that she’s more than just an actor and may check out
        her other gigs to learn more about her.

        Plus, that little blue tick shows up on her page, so people
        will immediately understand that she’s famous when visiting
        her Instagram account. One of the Instagram bio tips Queen
        Latifah teaches us is that you can learn a lot about a person
        even from a short bio. </string>
